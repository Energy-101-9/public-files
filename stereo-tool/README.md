Our presets for StereTool.  Requires for-pay features.

We'll be back to document this preset in more detail soon.

TL;DR for now:  You want to gain stage your input audio so that it's peaking around -6dBFS on the input VU meters.  

(There's another -12 gain stage before the proecessing, too...but integrated loudness for "program" in input should be about -6dBFS)
